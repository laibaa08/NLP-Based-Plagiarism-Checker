# NLP-Based Plagiarism Checker

##  Project Overview
This project is an **NLP-based Plagiarism Detection System** developed using Python.  
It compares two text documents and calculates their similarity using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)** and **Cosine Similarity** techniques.

The system detects:
- Overall plagiarism percentage
- Sentence-level similarity
- Common processed words
- Detailed plagiarism report

---

##  Objectives
- To understand text preprocessing using NLP
- To implement TF-IDF from scratch
- To calculate cosine similarity between documents
- To detect potential plagiarism in textual content

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Math Library
