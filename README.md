##  Project Overview
This project is an **NLP-based Plagiarism Detection System** developed using Python.  
It compares two text documents and calculates their similarity using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)** and **Cosine Similarity** techniques.

The system detects:
- Overall plagiarism percentage
- Sentence-level similarity
- Common processed words
- Detailed plagiarism report

---

##  Objectives
- To understand text preprocessing using NLP
- To implement TF-IDF from scratch
- To calculate cosine similarity between documents
- To detect potential plagiarism in textual content

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Math Library

---
##  How to Use

Run the program.

Enter the first text when prompted.

Enter the second text.

View plagiarism percentage.

Type yes to generate a detailed report.

 ## Output Details

Similarity < 30% → No plagiarism

30% – 50% → Low similarity

50% – 70% → Moderate similarity (possible paraphrasing)

> 70% → High similarity (possible plagiarism)


# Plagiarism Checker Report

This document shows sample execution results of the plagiarism checker.

## Similarity Result
- Overall Similarity: 58.21%
- Verdict: Moderate similarity

## Observations
- Several common keywords found after preprocessing
- Sentence-level similarity detected
- TF-IDF successfully captures contextual overlap
